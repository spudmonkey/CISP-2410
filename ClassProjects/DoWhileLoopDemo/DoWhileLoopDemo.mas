	Input			/ Read a value from the keyboard into AC
	Store		LCV	/ put our loop control value in LCV
loop,	Output			/ print our LCV -- we would go do our stuff here if this were a real loop
	Load		LCV	/ Load the LCV into AC
	Subt		step	/ subtract 1
	Store		LCV	/ store new LCV value
	Skipcond	800	/ if the LCV is still zero or larger keep going
	jump		stop	/ we are done
	Jump		loop	/ go back through
stop, 	Halt			/ end program
